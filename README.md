# pres-movie-relations
(In progress) An study in finding correlations between media themes (movies in this case) and terms of US presidents. Example: Eisenhower tops all for number of Westerns created under any presidency. GW Bush holds the record for Romance flicks. And there seems to be a strong correlation between Obama's terms and Super Hero movies.
