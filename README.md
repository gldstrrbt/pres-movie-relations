# pres-movie-relations
In the New York City subway, we're bombarded with advertisements no matter where we look. Whether you're waiting on the platform or sitting/standing on the train, it's inevitable that your eyes will engage with one. Having observed a significant shift in themes protrayed in movie and show ads between Obama's presidency (tons of superhero themes) and the current one (ungodly amount of patriotism), I decided to dig into the data in search of correlations.
